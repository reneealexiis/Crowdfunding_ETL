Hello, 

Our final notebook is in the "Starer_Code" file and it's labled "ETL_Mini_Project_RPerez_JBenavente.ipynb".
This contains the final script. 

All requested CSV files have been uploaded into the "Resources" folder, located in the "Starter_Code" folder. 

The DBD png is in the main folder. 

Jorge and I worked together on this project, with the help of the XPert AI Learning Assistant.

Thank you,
